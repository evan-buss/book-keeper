focus text box on input page load

Transitions:
  - Between pages
  - On load / delete of book cards
    - Can't get the load transition to work

CSS:
  - Default placeholder note should have a different style to stand out
  - Top right alert box that times out after a few seconds every time a book is added / deleted

Rebuild Project with cleaner structure:
  New vue-cli without webpack
  better file structure

title icon
  figure out how to make it work

Test implementing a progress bar

Figure out how to keep stars from changing shape when resized

Progress Bar:
  - Users can change their current book status

Android app with a webview that just loads the website
  - Would help learn about a simple webapp

Precendence:
  1) alerts

  2) clean up code
      remove many of the console logs

  3) User Validation
      - Users have their own accounts and book lists

Low-Tier:
  dark mode

  more buttons

  make home icon rotate on hover

  Page footers?

  Create an about page
    details the project structure and frameworks
  Add link to homepage

  Reset button on star-rating

  Make components universal (ie. remove references to notes / project specific names)

  Better documentation

  use something like this to hide alerts after a period of time
    - undo button?

  alert() {
    this.hideElt = false;
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.hideElt = true;
      this.resetModal();
    }, 4000);
  }
