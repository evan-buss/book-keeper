Notifications figure out how:
  - notifications stack vertically instead of covering each other.
  - might have a button to close the undo notification without undoing
  - figure out how to have an undo button on the message
    - can have a visible property on each card?
      - this would let me keep the same order

Transitions:
  - Between pages
  - modal
  - On load / delete of book cards
    - current card delete animation is too slow
    - Can't get the load transition to work

CSS:
  - Default placeholder note should have a different style to stand out
  - Top right alert box that times out after a few seconds every time a book is added / deleted

Figure out how to keep stars from changing shape when resized

Precendence:
  2) clean up code
      remove many of the console logs

  3) User Validation
      - Users have their own accounts and book lists

Low-Tier:
  dark mode - toggle switch

  more buttons to easily switch views after adding a book

  make home icon rotate on hover / eye effects

  Add link to homepage

  Reset button on star-rating

  Make components universal (ie. remove references to notes / project specific names)

  Better documentation

IDEAS:
    Android app with a webview that just loads the website
  - Would help learn about a simple webapp
