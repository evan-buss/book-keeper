Figure out how to get better comments in text files

Notifications figure out how:
  - notifications stack vertically instead of covering each other.
  - might have a button to close the undo notification without undoing

CSS:
  Figure out how to keep stars from changing shape when resized

Precendence:
Low-Tier:
  dark mode - toggle switch

  more buttons to easily switch views after adding a book

  make home icon rotate on hover / eye effects

  Add link to homepage

  Reset button on star-rating

  only include used components
    bulma components
    firebase components
      database
      authentication

IDEAS:
    Android app with a webview that just loads the website
  - Would help learn about a simple webapp
