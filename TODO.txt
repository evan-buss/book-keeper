Deletion message error not fixed...

Notifications figure out how:
  - notifications stack vertically instead of covering each other.
  - if user deletes another book before the previous message is gone,
    the new message is not shown on top, and subsequent book deletes are bugged and cannot be deleted.

CSS:
  Figure out how to keep stars from changing shape when resized

Precendence:
Low-Tier:
  make home icon rotate on hover / eye effects

  Add link to homepage

  Reset button on star-rating
IDEAS:
    Android app with a webview that just loads the website
  - Would help learn about a simple webapp
